LOCALIZATION REQUIREMENTS (it-IT)
========================

You MUST:
1) Write in Italian from Italy (vocabulary, idioms, tone).
2) Replace culturally specific examples, idioms, and references with Italy-relevant equivalents.
   - Use examples that feel natural for the Italian job market and everyday context.
3) Adapt jargon:
   - Keep common tech terms in English when Italians commonly use them (e.g., “frontend”, “backend”, “deploy”),
     but clarify briefly when needed.
4) Maintain an authoritative, practical tone:
   - Clear, professional, helpful
   - Avoid generic “AI voice”
5) Preserve structure:
   - Headings remain headings (H1/H2/H3)
   - Lists remain lists
   - Code blocks remain code blocks
6) SEO:
   - Strong search intent
   - Natural Italian keywords (Italy phrasing)
   - Avoid keyword stuffing
7) Length:
   - Keep similar depth to the English version (do not shorten aggressively)
