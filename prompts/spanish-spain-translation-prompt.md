LOCALIZATION REQUIREMENTS (es-ES)
========================

You MUST:
1) Write in Spanish from Spain (vocabulary, tone, and phrasing).
2) Replace culturally specific examples, idioms, and references with Spain-relevant equivalents.
   - Use examples that feel natural for the Spanish job market and daily context.
3) Adapt jargon:
   - Keep widely used tech terms in English when normal in Spain (e.g., “frontend”, “backend”, “deploy”),
     but clarify when needed.
4) Maintain an authoritative, practical tone:
   - Clear, professional, helpful
   - Avoid generic “AI voice”
5) Preserve structure:
   - Keep headings as headings (H1/H2/H3)
   - Keep lists as lists
   - Keep code blocks as code blocks
6) SEO:
   - Strong search intent
   - Natural Spanish keywords (Spain phrasing)
   - Avoid keyword stuffing
7) Length:
   - Keep similar depth to the English version (do not over-compress)
