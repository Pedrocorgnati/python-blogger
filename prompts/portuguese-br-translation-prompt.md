LOCALIZATION REQUIREMENTS (pt-BR)
========================

You MUST:
1) Keep meaning and strategy, but rewrite for Brazilian Portuguese fluency.
2) Replace culturally specific examples, idioms, and references with Brazilian equivalents where appropriate.
   - Use examples Brazilians relate to (job market, career shifts, daily life analogies).
3) Adapt jargon:
   - Keep common tech terms in English when Brazilians commonly use them (e.g., "frontend", "backend", "deploy", "pull request"),
     but explain briefly when needed.
4) Maintain an authoritative, helpful tone:
   - Clear, direct, professional
   - No fluff and no “AI-sounding” phrases
5) Preserve structure:
   - Headings (H1/H2/H3) must remain headings
   - Lists remain lists
   - Code blocks remain code blocks
6) SEO:
   - Keep search intent strong
   - Use natural Portuguese keywords
   - Avoid keyword stuffing
7) Length:
   - Keep similar depth and completeness as the English version (do not shorten aggressively)
